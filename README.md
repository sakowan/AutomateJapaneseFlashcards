# 🇯🇵 Kanji Pronunciation Audio Generator 🎧

This is a simple script that allows you to upload a CSV file where each row contains a **kanji 漢字**. The script then generates **MP3 audio files** with the kanji name being read aloud. This is especially useful for language learners who want to practice hearing kanji pronunciations in preparation for the JLPT or general Japanese conversation. 🎶

## 📜 Purpose
I created this script in preparation for studying for the **JLPT**. While I did plenty of reading practice, I found that I often struggled to recognize words in **conversation**, even though I knew the meaning when reading them. This script allows you to generate audio files for kanji readings, which you can then use to improve your listening comprehension. 🎧

You can easily add the generated MP3 files to your **Anki** flashcard deck or any other spaced repetition system to help reinforce your listening skills. 📚

## 🛠️ Features
- Upload a CSV where each row contains a single kanji.
- Automatically generates MP3 files with the kanji being read aloud.
- Great for improving listening comprehension and pronunciation.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Prepare a CSV file where each row contains one kanji you’d like to practice.
2. Run the script.
3. The script will generate MP3 files with the pronunciation of each kanji.
4. Add the MP3 files to your Anki deck or any other flashcard system!
